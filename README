	    README for Search Date Changer

------------------------------------------------------------

[DESCRIPTION]

This 'Search Date Changer'(or 'SDC') chrome extension
enables you to change Google search result date range
easily.

When you searched some words by Google, SDC icon is on the
OmniBox(or as known as URL box).  By clicking the icon, you
can change your Google search results with specified date
range.  SDC icon will be just only for Google Web search,
News search, Video search, and Books search.

Every icon clicking, search range changes in the order 'Any
time', 'Latest', 'Past 24 hours', 'Past week', 'Past month',
and 'Past year'.  If you'd like to know what the icon means,
please put your mouse cursor on the icon and tool-tip shows
current mode.

You can select SDC mode from Chrome extensions option menu.
With clicking right mouse button on SDC icon or from
Google chrome extension menu, you can see SDC's option
view.

Please check 'Enable' check-box for your preferred behavior.
If you check 'Force user setting for any search' check box
and Google search result date range does not match the one
you select as 'Enable', SDC tries to re-search again with
search result date range which you check as 'Enabled'
automatically.  To select search result date range for this
automatic selection, 'Default' option will be used.
