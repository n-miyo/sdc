version 0.2:
- Set up initial 'publish date' search option based on
  current URL, instead of starting from 'Recent results'.
- Fix bug for occurring wrong modification if you click this
  extension button when URL already has 'publish date' option.

This extension adds 'Publish date' option to your Google
search results and update them in new search setting.

If you search some words by Google, you can see clock icon
at omni-box with search results.  This icon enables you to
add 'Publish date' option, which you can see in 'Show
options' menu for search results.  You can click the icon,
search results will be updated with the new 'Publish date'
option.

By clicking the icon, 'Publish date' option will be changed
in the same order to Google's menu, such as, 'Any time',
'Latest', 'Past 24 hours', 'Past week', 'Past year'.  If
your mouse is on the icon, tool-tip shows next search option.
